## About the project

Project created by **Ornella Radica** developed with React.

I decided to make the project with Next.js to use the framework router and some internal components like Image, Link and Head. I also used Tailwind CSS to style the website.

In this project the backend was not done using Next.js API routes, I deployed a Node.js with express server in Railway to fetch the data from Shopify.
